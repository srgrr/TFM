# COLLECTION\_IN DRIVER PROGRAM
These programs test the COLLECTION_IN feature.

The two main apps do the same thing: create some parameters, and transfer them
packed inside the same COLLECTION_IN. The only difference between these two applications
are in where the objects are created (master or worker), as this difference induces
a total different behavior in some parts of the COMPSs Runtime that are modified or
implemented for/in this project.
