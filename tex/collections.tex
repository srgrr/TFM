\section{Collections in COMPSs}
\label{sec:col}
As we have seen in previous sections and examples, a COMPSs parameter is basically a regular user-code object, as a \verb|numpy.ndarray| with added metadata that allows the COMPSs Runtime to compute any dependency between tasks induced by this particular object.
% Explain that this definition is sometimes not enough for some use-cases

\subsection{Collection as Input Parameters}
\label{subsec:col_in}
The first step in this implementation consists of enabling the COMPSs Programming Model to accept collections fully composed of input parameters.

\subsection{Collections as INOUT Parameters}
\label{subsec:col_inout}
