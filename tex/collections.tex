\section{Collections in COMPSs}
\label{sec:col}
As we have seen in previous sections and examples, a COMPSs parameter is basically a regular user-code object, as a \verb|numpy.ndarray|, with additional metadata to help the COMPSs Runtime to compute any dependency between tasks induced by this particular object.\\
\\
A very common issue reported by COMPSs users is that the programming model is not able to detect dependencies induced by attributes or contents. Many examples are valid: an array \verb|[object(), some_future_object]|, an instance of a class with some attribute that is a future object... or some object that has been used in a super-object.\\
\\
The ideal solution, which consists of implementing a generic introspection algorithm, is very hard, if not impossible, to implement. Python is a language with no types, some objects can be modified if iterated, many others have no easy way to list its internal attributes, circular references can happen... the list is almost endless. However, this use case is pretty common, so something must be done. An interesting observation is that any sub object will necesarrily have the same direction as the super object sent as a task parameter. This represents an edge that can be exploited to obtain some performance. These two reasons are more than enough to consider implementing some kind of support for this feature.\\
\\
After some meetings it was decided that support for arrays should be implemented in the COMPSs Programming Model. Given that many COMPSs users find words like \textit{array, hash map, reflection, inheritance} complicated and misleading it was decided to call this feature as \textit{support for collections}. This name also gives the opportunity to extend this implementation to other iterable data structures such as sets, hash maps and so on.\\

\subsection{Collections as Input Parameters}
\label{subsec:col_in}
The first step consists of enabling the COMPSs Programming Model to accept collections fully composed of input parameters. This step will also help us to identify and to mark all the parts that require some implementation and/or modification when dealing with this feature.\\
\\
This feature should cover these two cases:


\subsection{Collections of Collections: (Matrices)}
\label{subsec:col_depth}

\subsection{Collections as INOUT Parameters}
\label{subsec:col_inout}

\subsection{Some practical examples}
