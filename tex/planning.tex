\section{Tasks and time planning}
This project intends to implement various features aimed to improve the object management stage of the COMPSs programming model. These features may depend on some previous features or they may be totally independent and disjoint. This project also requires some additional tasks, as writing this document. All tasks, with their dependencies, can be found in figure \ref{fig:thesis_task_graph}.
