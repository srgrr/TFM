# Master's Thesis Repository
This repository contains all the LaTeX, images, source codes, experiments, and results from my master's thesis.

This thesis is developed at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS) in the Workflows and Distributed Computing group (@bsc-wdc).

## Preliminary observations
All the scripts and programs have been run and tested under Debian-like OS. Some scripts won't work on other OS due to that (e.g: the ones that use specific package managers).

## LaTeX Document
The LaTeX document can be built as follows:
```
./install_dependencies.sh
./make_tex.sh
```
This will generate a `tfm.pdf` in the root folder.
